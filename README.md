My Name is OJASVI VASHISHT.
This is an Android App which connects with HC-05 bluetooth module to control an arduino bot. It utilises classic bluetooth.
The app is made in Kotlin on android studio.
I am also providing the apk file to run this app.
it works on almost all android devices android 8+.
currently the app does not work as it is unable to load paired bluetooth devices and connect to bluetooth properly.
If you somehow manage to make this work plz mail me at the.ojasvi.vashisht@gmail.com , I will implement the changes and also mention the contributors.
thank you.
